## Instructions for running the java executable
* on the command line paste: 
* java executable path-to-csv
* optional- the name of the file is MyPermutations.java, so the first command would be javac /path-to-java-file/MyPermutations.java
* the name of the executable created(or you can use the already created executable which looks like: "MyPermutation.class") would be MyPermutations, and say the csv "abc.csv" is on the Desktop, so the command would be(without inverted commas): "java path-to-MyPermutations /path-to-Desktop/abc.csv"
